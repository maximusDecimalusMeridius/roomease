## Installation

To install, download the files found in the root directory of github.  Create a `.env` file with `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PW` fields to connect to your MySQL database, as well as `SESSION_SECRET` when defining your session object in `./index.js`.  Run `npm install` in the root directory once downloaded to install required dependencies.

## Usage

Once installed, users can test functionality with Insomnia, Postmates, or another API endpoint tester, or build and connect front end functionality. (Will update to functioning heroku link).
